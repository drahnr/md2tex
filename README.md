# md2tex

A small utility to convert markdown files to tex. Forked from [md2pdf](https://gitea.tforgione.fr/tforgione/md2pdf/), with an added focus on mdbook conversions. Also with the goal of contributing back upstream.

Used by [mdbook-latex](https://github.com/lbeckman314/mdbook-latex) to generate PDF's.

## Usage

```sh
md2tex -i input.md -o output.tex
```
